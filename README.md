# RustGL
Learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) while learning more complex techniques for shaders using [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) with the [Glium](https://github.com/glium/glium) library.

I've used WebGL a few times, but the most impressive thing I made was a really simple Raymarcher. Hoping to do some cool raytracing, transformations w/ matricies, frustum culling, etc etc.
